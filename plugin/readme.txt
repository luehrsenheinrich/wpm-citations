This Plugin introduces practical citation functionality to the WordPress Block Editor, aiming to streamline the process of adding references to your content.

## Features

1.  **Cite Rich Text Format**: This feature lets users mark citations in their text and assign them a specific source. This makes adding citations straightforward, enhancing the clarity and reliability of your content.
2.  **Bibliography Block**: This plugin also offers a bibliography block that displays all referenced sources. The plugin creates links between your in-text citations and their corresponding sources in the bibliography block, making it easier for readers to find and check your references.
