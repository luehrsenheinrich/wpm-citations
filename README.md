[![🏗 Build & Deploy](../../actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/main.yml)

This WordPress plugin introduces practical citation functionality to the WordPress Block Editor, aiming to streamline the process of adding references to your content.

This WordPress project is made with love and brought to you by the folks of [WP Munich](http://www.wp-munich.com) and [Luehrsen // Heinrich](http://www.luehrsen-heinrich.de).

## Features

1.  **Cite Rich Text Format**: This feature lets users mark citations in their text and assign them a specific source. This makes adding citations straightforward, enhancing the clarity and reliability of your content.
2.  **Bibliography Block**: This plugin also offers a bibliography block that displays all referenced sources. The plugin creates links between your in-text citations and their corresponding sources in the bibliography block, making it easier for readers to find and check your references.
